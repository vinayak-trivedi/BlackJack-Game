# BlackJack-Game
It is a popular casino game. It is not like the real one. I have made this project under the scrimba front end course. There are certain features that I have added myself like prompting the user to enter their name and rendering it out when they play the game to give them a personalized experience, and reducing the amount of chips that the user have when he start playing and when he draws a new card.
I will add another feature in the future, in which the user will win 20 chips everytime he gets a blackjack.
